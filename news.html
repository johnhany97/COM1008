                <p>A recent study conducted on thousands of teenagers in the past couple of months showed a very interesting development. 50% of the teenagers involved in the research were asked to solve a puzzle per day while the other teens were simply asked not to solve any.</p>
                <p>After two months, All of the study's participants were asked to endure a test that tested their solving skills on various puzzles. Almost all of the teens who solved puzzles for the past two months were able to solve the test and finish within less than half of the allowed time while the rest of the teens either barely finished or didn't even finish at all!</p>
                <p>This research has only proved and increased our belief in the importance of puzzles! That's why, Puzzle Mania is proud to announce that 3 more puzzles are in the works right now and quite near to release date, so stay tunes and puzzle on!</p>
