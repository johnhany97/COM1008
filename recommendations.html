					<!-- Short review -->
                    <p>Pzzls is a puzzles website of a different type. They offer lots of different logical puzzles, riddles, scientific and mathematical puzzles. They are not the easiest to solve but they're the most enjoyable when solved! Definitely recommend this website if you want to take your puzzle solving to the next level.</p>
